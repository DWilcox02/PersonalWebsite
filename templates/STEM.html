                        In 2020, I participated in the "4x4 In Schools Land Rover Competition." The aim of the competition is to innovate a new Land Rover car design and build a prototype, which draws heavily on Engineering, applied science, applied mathematics, CAD/CAM, Electronics, financial management and ICT. 
                        The overall process took 5 months, spanning September 2019 to January 2020, where we presented our own design against 26 other teams in the development class.
                        <br><br> As an Eagle Scout in our American Scouting Troop, I already had leadership experience, so I took on the role of Team Leader. I managed communication and organisation, overseeing the work of the other 5 members of our team, while applying my own knowledge and expertise in areas like Arduino programming. 
                        After months of stress and hard work, our team achieved <strong>1st place at the London and Southeast Regional Finals</strong>, and were invited to the National Finals taking place in March. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final competition was cancelled.
                        <br><br> Alongside my role as team leader, I was the sole programmer of our ACES Innovation project in the competition, where I designed a system to analyse and map out a given surrounding environment. Using an Arduino, I was able to gather the 8-bit information sent through a potentiometer into my PCâ€™s serial port 
                        and convert it into radians around a unit circle. From there, combined with the distance sensor and an SDL/Code-Blocks program, I could successfully map out the area surrounding the 
                        sensor by rotating the potentiometer. The idea was to refine it using gyroscopes and accelerometers and attach it to our vehicle with a Raspberry Pi, but the competition was cancelled due to Covid-19 before we ordered the parts.
